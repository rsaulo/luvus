//! Agent detection (M3, docs/07). Two questions, two very different answers.
//!
//! **Which agent is this?** The pane's running processes (docs/07 §2.1), passed
//! in as `running`. An agent is a program, so this is ground truth; a pane that
//! merely *prints* "claude" is a shell. Where processes can't be seen (Windows,
//! a remote pane) it falls back to text, ranked by how deliberate that text is —
//! spawn command, then OSC title, then output — with names that double as
//! ordinary words (`amp`, `cursor`, `droid`, `grok`, `pi`) believed only from
//! the first two. Identity is configurable: see `[identity]` in the manifests.
//!
//! **What state is it in?** Inferred from what's on screen via a small
//! **manifest** engine: a set of rules, each tied to a screen region (the OSC
//! title or the recent bottom text), a priority, and one or more conditions
//! (substrings / a spinner glyph). The highest-priority matching rule wins. Built-in rules cover the
//! markers common to modern agent CLIs plus a few per-agent quirks; **users can
//! add or override rules** by dropping `*.toml` files in `~/.luvus/manifests/`
//! (loaded at startup, merged by priority) so detection can be fixed or extended
//! for any agent without recompiling.
//!
//! A recognised agent is *working* only when a rule proves it (a spinner, an
//! interrupt hint) — raw output never counts, so a launching CLI's welcome
//! screen or a scrolling log can't fake the state. Plain shells (no markers to
//! match) fall back to output activity, gated by whether the user typed
//! recently, so keystroke echo at a prompt is never misread as work. luvus's
//! status debounce (docs/07, `QUIET_DWELL`) supplies stability: a momentary
//! non-match can't flip a working agent to idle.
