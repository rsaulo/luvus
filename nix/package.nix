# nixpkgs package definition for luvus.
#
# This is written to drop straight into nixpkgs at
# `pkgs/by-name/lu/luvus/package.nix`. It differs from the repo's `flake.nix`
# in the two ways nixpkgs requires: it fetches a *released tag* with a fixed
# hash (rather than the local tree), and it vendors dependencies via `cargoHash`
# (rather than a local `cargoLock.lockFile`). See `nix/README.md` for how to fill
# in the two `lib.fakeHash` placeholders and submit the PR.

  # On macOS, Cargo.toml deliberately links the SYSTEM sqlite
  # (/usr/lib/libsqlite3.dylib) instead of bundling it, so the crate passes
  # `-lsqlite3` at the final link. The Nix build sandbox has no /usr/lib, so
  # the link fails with `ld: library not found for -lsqlite3`. Provide nixpkgs'
  # sqlite on Darwin: the link resolves, and the dylib lands in the runtime
  # closure. Linux keeps rusqlite's bundled engine and needs nothing extra.

  # luvus shells out to these at runtime; bake them into PATH because NixOS has
  # no implicit global one. The user's own PATH is still appended, so a newer
  # git/gh they installed wins. `ps` is Linux-only here (procps); on Darwin the
  # system `ps` is used.
